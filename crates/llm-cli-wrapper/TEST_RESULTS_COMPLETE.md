- Supports multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Switch models mid-session without losing context
- Terminal-native with polished TUI
- Integrates with language servers for code intelligence

---

## Issues Fixed in This Session

### 1. ✅ Codex Not Working in Test Directories
**Problem**: Codex failed with "Not inside a trusted directory" error
**Solution**: Added `--skip-git-repo-check` flag to exec command
**File**: `src/cli/codex.rs:53`

### 2. ✅ OpenCode Discovery and Integration
**Added**:
- OpenCode CLI type to enum (src/cli/types.rs)
- OpenCode implementation (src/cli/opencode.rs)
- Registry integration (src/cli/registry.rs)
- Command parser support (src/main.rs)

**Command Format**: Uses `opencode run "message"` for execution

## Integration Readiness

### ✅ Ready for Agent Orchestrator

The CLI wrapper can now:

1. **CLI Selection**
   - Automatically discover all 4 installed CLIs
   - Check health before task assignment
   - Select best CLI based on task requirements

2. **Health Monitoring**
   - Pre-execution health checks
   - Performance tracking
   - Automatic fallback to alternative CLIs

3. **Task Routing**
   - Vision tasks → Claude or Gemini
   - Large context → Gemini (1M tokens)
   - Privacy-sensitive → OpenCode (local models)
   - General coding → Claude (fastest)
   - Complex reasoning → Codex

4. **Quality Gates**
   - Verify CLI availability before workflow
   - Validate output quality
   - Track execution times
