# ACP (Agent Client Protocol) Integration for AO

**Date:** April 2026  
**Status:** Design - Research & Planning Phase  
**Scope:** AO as ACP-compliant agent server for IDE integration (VS Code, JetBrains, Cursor)

---

## Executive Summary

This document evaluates the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) specification and proposes how the AO CLI could expose an ACP-compatible server interface, enabling IDEs to connect to AO as a standardized agent provider without vendor lock-in. The integration positions AO as a universal agent orchestrator that can serve any IDE that implements ACP, expanding its accessibility and value proposition.

---

## 1. Agent Client Protocol (ACP) Specification Summary

### 1.1 Overview

The Agent Client Protocol is a standardized, open protocol for communication between code editors/IDEs and coding agents, created by JetBrains and Zed. It solves the integration overhead problem where each agent-editor pairing requires custom integration work.

**Core Principle:** Agents implementing ACP work with any ACP-compatible editor without vendor-specific modifications.

### 1.2 Architecture & Communication Models

#### Local Deployment
- Agent runs as a sub-process of the editor
- Communication via **JSON-RPC** over standard input/output (stdio)
- Low latency, no network overhead
- Suitable for local agent execution

#### Remote Deployment
- Agent hosted in cloud or separate infrastructure
- Communication over **HTTP** or **WebSocket** (HTTP support stable, WebSocket documented as work-in-progress)
- Enables centralized agent management
- Supports collaborative and distributed workflows

### 1.3 Core Concepts & Message Flow

#### Session-Based Workflow
ACP organizes agent activity around **sessions** — isolated conversation contexts that persist state and history.

**Key Session Methods:**
- `session/new` — Create a new conversation session
- `session/load` — Resume an existing session
- `session/list` — Enumerate available sessions
- `session/prompt` — Send user input and receive agent responses
- `session/cancel` — Cancel ongoing operations
- `session/setMode` — Switch agent operating modes (e.g., planning, editing, analysis)
- `session/setConfigOption` — Adjust session-specific settings

#### Initialization & Authentication
- `initialize` — Establishes connection, negotiates capabilities, exchanges protocol versions
- `authenticate` — Validates client identity (optional, implementation-dependent)

#### Bidirectional Operations

**Client-Initiated (Editor → Agent):**
- Session and conversation management
- Mode and configuration changes

**Agent-Initiated (Agent → Editor):**
- `fs/readTextFile`, `fs/writeTextFile` — File system access with user approval
- `fs/createFile`, `fs/deleteFile`, `fs/renameFile` — File lifecycle operations
- `terminal/create`, `terminal/output`, `terminal/kill`, `terminal/release` — Terminal access
- `requestPermission` — Request user authorization for sensitive operations

#### Content Representation

ACP supports multiple content types for rich communication:

| Content Type | Use Case |
|---|---|
| **TextContent** | Markdown-formatted responses, explanations, code snippets |
| **ImageContent** | Visual diagrams, UI mockups, terminal screenshots |
| **AudioContent** | Voice feedback, spoken explanations |
| **ResourceLink** | External references (docs, tools, artifacts) |
| **EmbeddedResource** | Self-contained attachments (base64 encoded) |

**Default Format:** Markdown, chosen for flexibility without requiring HTML rendering capabilities in all editors.

#### Capability Negotiation

Both clients and agents declare capabilities during initialization:

**Client Capabilities (what the editor can do):**
- File system (read, write, delete, rename)
- Terminal (create, execute, interact)
- MCP tool support (stdio, HTTP, SSE transports)
- Sampling and prompt handling
- Planning and session management

**Agent Capabilities (what the agent can do):**
- Session persistence
- Mode switching (planning, editing, analysis, etc.)
- Tool/MCP integration
- Artifact generation
- Cost tracking

### 1.4 MCP Integration

ACP leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool extension:
- Agents declare available MCP servers during initialization
- Editors configure MCP clients to connect to agent-managed tool servers
- Supported MCP transports: **stdio, HTTP, SSE**
- Enables standardized tool access across any agent

### 1.5 Planning & Execution

ACP includes first-class support for planning workflows:
- Agents can expose a `plan` capability showing steps, status, and dependencies
- Plans include priority levels, execution order, and completion tracking
- Editors can visualize and interact with agent plans

## 2. How AO Maps to ACP Concepts

### 2.1 Current AO Architecture

AO is a Rust-only agent orchestrator with:

- **16-crate modular workspace** with clean separation of concerns
- **CLI surface** exposing `project`, `queue`, `task`, `workflow`, and other command groups
- **Web UI** (React 18) for visualization and management
- **Runtime state** scoped under `~/.ao/<repo-scope>/`
- **Workflow YAML** overlays in `.ao/workflows.yaml` and `.ao/workflows/*.yaml`
- **Agent runner** orchestrating multi-step tasks with LLM and tool execution
- **MCP tool provider** exposing custom tools to agents
- **Daemon mode** for background task execution and status tracking

### 2.2 ACP Server Mapping

#### Session → AO Workflow/Task Context

| ACP Concept | AO Equivalent | Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| `session/new` | `ao workflow new` | Creates a new workflow task with isolation |
| `session/load` | `ao workflow status --id` or task recovery | Resumes workflow state from scoped runtime |
| `session/list` | `ao queue list` or `ao workflow list` | Lists active/pending tasks |
| `session/prompt` | `ao task run` with input | Accepts user input, executes workflow step |
| `session/cancel` | `ao task cancel --id` | Cancels running workflow |
| `session/setMode` | Workflow config mode selection | Switch between agent execution strategies |

#### Agent Capabilities → AO Services

| ACP Capability | AO Service |
|---|---|
| `executeCommand` / agent-initiated code execution | Orchestrator agent runner with sandbox isolation |
| `fs/readTextFile`, `fs/writeTextFile` | Git-ops layer with version control integration |
| `terminal/create`, `terminal/output` | Workflow runner v2 with subprocess management |
| MCP tool server | AO's built-in MCP provider (`orchestrator-providers`) |
| Session persistence | Scoped runtime state at `~/.ao/<repo-scope>/` |

#### File System Access & Git Safety

AO can map ACP file operations to its **git-ops layer** (`orchestrator-git-ops`):
- `fs/readTextFile` → Read from working tree or staged state
- `fs/writeTextFile` → Write to working tree (with user approval via `requestPermission`)
- `fs/createFile` / `fs/deleteFile` → Git-tracked creation/deletion
- Benefits: Automatic version control, change tracking, easy rollback

#### Terminal Integration

AO's `workflow-runner-v2` manages subprocess execution:
- `terminal/create` → Spawn workflow task subprocess
- `terminal/output` → Stream task output to editor
- `terminal/kill` → Terminate task execution
- `terminal/release` → Clean up task resources

### 2.3 Project Scope Management

ACP doesn't natively define "project scope," but AO can map it:

| Scenario | ACP Handling | AO Enhancement |
|---|---|---|
| Single project | Editor passes project path in session metadata | Extract repo scope from `.git` |
| Multiple projects | Editor manages separate sessions per project | Use `--project-root` to link session to scope |
| Monorepo / workspace | Separate logical projects within filesystem | Scoped runtime per logical project |

AO's natural scoping via `.ao/` and `~/.ao/<repo-scope>/` aligns well with ACP's session isolation model.

### 2.4 Workflow Visualization & Planning

ACP's planning capabilities can expose AO's workflow structure:

```json
{
  "plan": {
    "taskId": "TASK-123",
    "title": "Implement new feature",
    "status": "in-progress",
    "steps": [
      {
        "id": "step-1",
        "title": "Gather requirements",
        "status": "completed",
        "priority": 1
      },
      {
        "id": "step-2",
        "title": "Design architecture",
        "status": "in-progress",
        "priority": 2
      },
      {
        "id": "step-3",
        "title": "Implement solution",
        "status": "pending",
        "priority": 3
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

AO can expose workflow execution plans through this structure, giving editors first-class visibility into multi-step agent execution.

## 5. Risks & Mitigations

### 5.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **ACP spec maturity** | Medium | Monitor spec evolution; design for forward compatibility; keep ACP server modular for updates |
| **Editor integration complexity** | High | Start with VS Code (largest market); reuse existing ACP client libraries; invest in testing |
| **Session state coherence** | High | Leverage existing scoped runtime model; test concurrent sessions; clear semantics on conflict resolution |
| **Performance at scale** | Medium | Benchmark session throughput; optimize JSON parsing; consider connection pooling |
| **Dependency versioning** | Low | Pin ACP spec versions; test with multiple editor versions |

### 5.2 Market Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **ACP adoption slower than expected** | Medium | Build ACP support as optional feature; maintain CLI + Web UI as primary surfaces |
| **Tight editor integrations remain dominant** | Medium | Emphasize OSS, cost, and privacy advantages; build early examples and case studies |
| **Enterprise procurement friction** | Medium | Provide hosted SaaS option; offer support contracts; maintain audit/compliance docs |

### 5.3 Residual Concerns

- **ACP specification may continue to evolve** — Plan for periodic updates to AO ACP server
- **IDE ecosystem is fragmented** — Each IDE (VS Code extensions, JetBrains plugins) has unique build/deploy processes
- **First IDE integration will set tone** — Prioritize quality and documentation for initial integrations
- **Session state debugging will be complex** — Invest in logging, tracing, and diagnostics

---

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Phase 1 completion:** Working ACP server that VS Code can connect to
- **Phase 2 completion:** End-to-end task execution (initialize → prompt → response → file edit) working from IDE
- **Phase 3 completion:** Permission-gated file and terminal operations tested
- **Adoption:** 100+ developers using AO via IDE extensions within 6 months of launch
- **Enterprise wins:** 3+ enterprise customers citing "IDE + agent flexibility" as deciding factor

---

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Validate:** Confirm ACP spec gaps (remote auth, session migration) don't block AO integration
2. **Prototype:** Spike `ao-acp-server` crate with basic `initialize` and `session/new` handlers
3. **IDE Integration:** Build VS Code extension POC connecting to local AO server
4. **Gather Feedback:** Get early users testing and provide input on UX, performance, missing features
5. **Schedule Implementation:** Plan phased rollout with clear milestones and testing gates
